    "# Priority Queues with Binary Heaps\n",
    "- One important variation of a queues is called a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front.\n",
    "- However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back.\n",
    "- When you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called binary heap.\n",
    "- A binary heap will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The binary heap has two common variations: the *min heap*, in which the smallest key is always at the front, and the *max heap*, in which the largest key value is always at the front.\n",
    "- In this section we will implement the min heap."
