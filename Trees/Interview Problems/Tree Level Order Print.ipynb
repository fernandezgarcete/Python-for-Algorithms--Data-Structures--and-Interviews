    "# Solution\n",
    "It won't be practical to solve this problem using recursion, because recursion is similar to depth first search, but what we need here is breadth first search. So we will use a queue as we did previously in breadth first search. First, we'll push the root node into the queue. Then we start a while loop with the condition queue not being empty. Then, at each iteration we pop a node from the beginning of the queue and push its children to the end of the queue. Once we pop a node we prints its value and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the new line in correct place we should count the number of nodes at each level. We will have 2 counts, namely current level count and next level count. Current level count indicates how many nodes should be printed at this level before printing a new line. We decrement it every time we pop an element from the queue and print it. Once the current level count reaches zero we print a new line. Next level count contains the number of nodes in the next level, which will become the current level count after printing a new line. We count th number of nodes in the next level by counting the number of children of the nodes in the current level. Understanding the code is easier than its explanation:"
